    "In the previous sections we discovered how to use a ``HoloMap`` to build a Jupyter notebook with interactive visualizations that can be exported to a standalone HTML file, as well as how to use ``DynamicMap`` and ``Streams`` to set up dynamic interactivity backed by the Jupyter Python kernel. However, frequently we want to package our visualization or dashboard for wider distribution, backed by Python but run outside of the notebook environment. Bokeh Server provides a flexible and scalable architecture to deploy complex interactive visualizations and dashboards, integrating seamlessly with Bokeh and with HoloViews.\n",

    "For a detailed background on Bokeh Server see [the Bokeh user guide](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html). In this tutorial we will discover how to deploy the visualizations we have created so far as a standalone Bokeh Server app, and how to flexibly combine HoloViews and ParamBokeh to build complex apps. We will also reuse a lot of what we have learned so far---loading large, tabular datasets, applying Datashader operations to them, and adding linked Streams to our app.\n",
